# Voting App - FreeCodeCamp

This is my solution for the FreeCodeCamp challenge [Build a Voting App](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/build-a-voting-app).

You can see a live version running [here](https://fcc-votingapp.glitch.me/).

### How To Run

  - Run `npm install` to download the dependencies;
  - Create a `.env` file with the following structure and fill the gaps:
```
HOSTNAME=
PORT=
SESSION_SECRET=
GITHUB_ID=
GITHUB_SECRET=
TWITTER_ID=
TWITTER_SECRET=
```
  - Make sure you have MongoDB running;
  - Run `npm start` to run the application;
